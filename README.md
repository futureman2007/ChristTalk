# 📱 ChristTalk
*A community-driven Christian chat app for Android*

ChristTalk aims to provide an open, privacy-respecting WhatsApp-like chat application for Christians worldwide — with an additional unique feature: a **“Radar Mode”** that detects other ChristTalk users nearby (via local wireless technologies) and allows spontaneous, server-free chatting.

The project is in its early stages and **open to ideas, discussions, and contributions**. Nothing is set in stone yet — this is a young and evolving project.

The original idea was inspired by **R3alism**
